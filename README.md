### Hi there 👋
[![Rocket banner for rockaBe](https://github.com/rockaBe/rockaBe/raw/master/assets/rocket.svg)](https://www.rockabe.de)
I'm a passionate developer based in Berlin (Germany), currently workining at [Babbel](https://uk.babbel.com)

- 🔭 I’m currently working on updating my personal websites
- 🌱 I’m currently learning server side rendering with react and different tools
- 📫 How to reach me: an issue in [this repo](https://github.com/rockaBe/rockaBe) is a good start, I can give you more personal info after this, you can try also on twitter, but I may not reply there



P.S. Some of my repos are a bit old, I'm keeping them as memories and to track how am I growing as a developer, so, please keep in mind the dates when checking for the repos
